# About the Project
I used Bulletproof React for this project because it provides a modular structure and helps keep the folder organization clean and scalable. This is the structure I generally follow in most of my projects.

Currently, the project uses mock data. However, in real-world applications, I typically use TanStack Query. It makes handling API calls significantly easier and provides convenient access to features like caching and refetching.

I believe it's more appropriate to handle filtering on the backend, so I'm implementing the filtering logic within the mock API.
